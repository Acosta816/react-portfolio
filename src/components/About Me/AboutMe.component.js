                Hello, thank you for visiting my site. My name is David.
                I am a devoted programmer who specializes in making modern web apps.
                Here is my story...
            </p>
            <p className="about-me">
                ["EARLY CHILDHOOD"] 
                <br/>
                When I was 7, I made my first websites using Macromedia Dreamweaver, Angelfire, & Front Page Express with the help of my brother.
                <br/>
                Then I discovered <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/animate.html#scroll"><span className="adobe">Macromedia Flash 5</span></a>. 
                I was completely enamored. I used the sites I made to host my flash films that I had made from scratch frame by frame. 
                I was in love with flash's ability to turn my boring websites into an online arcade hosting mini games and my own flash films. I even made my first "fly swatter" flash game.
                <br/>
                All this on my first PC, the e-Tower 400ix by E-Machines running windows 98.
            </p>
            <p className="about-me">
                ["COLLEGE"]
                <br/>
                Fast forward to college. I really cared about helping people directly so I studied to be an EMT at SBC.
                <br/>
                I put in my 150 hours of real emergency calls and learned an incredible amount of discipline, team coordination, and focus. 
                <br/>
                All this while taking C#, Java, C++, CS fundamentals, Web development, and even virtualization.
            </p>

            <p className="about-me">
                ["BUSINESS"]
                <br/>
                Later on, I went into business with my brother and formed a tech company called "Cell Gate".
                We'd purchase phones and tablets in bulk, update the firmware, unlock them, fix them etc. Then import to the Baja market & distribute at an affordable price.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Soon after, I met my wife, and we formed a small tech business making custom designs on photoshop and using PNEUMONIC SUBLIMATION to print phone cases and anything else custom.
                We sold the company and moved back home to California where I worked as a Client Account Manager for GPI.
            </p>

            <p className="about-me">
                ["TODAY"]
                <br/>
                With the support of my fiancé/best friend, I pursued PROGRAMMING again, married my fiancé/best friend, 
                and graduated as an Engineer on may 2nd 2021.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Today I partner with small businesses to help them create more revenue by building them a website, 
                creating an online presence with listed directories, SEO, and social media.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                ["FUTURE/HORIZONS"]
                <br/>
                I am always looking to grow and make new connections for life. 
                I know I have a lot to offer and a LOT more still to learn from everyone I meet. 
                I'm not looking for a comfortable job or an easy one. 
                I strive to constantly challenge myself and create meaningful products for the world.
                <br/>
                Let's connect and build it together! :)

// First with C# and unity and then later in college.
// I decided I needed more modern structure to my learning if I was to ever
// turn this into a career so I took a formal 9 month bootcamp at thinkful's fullstack academy.
// Since graduating I have been persuing projects of my own and expanding my knowledge of web
// development and programming. I've found what drives me as a person and have only gotten stronger
// I also love Udemy and use it everyday to stay up to date with syntax.

// <p className="about-me">
// I dream of one day combining my love for people and technology to write
// software that can help the disabled communicate easier with the rest of the world.
// I am still actively learning and am currently deeply interested in the world of
// gamified learning as well as other forms of alternative learning. I feel it will lead us
// to a new paradigm and I look forward to being a part of that.
